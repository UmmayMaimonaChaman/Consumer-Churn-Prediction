Machine Learning Project

# Consumer_Classification

## 📌 Project Overview

**Consumer_Classification** is a machine learning project developed for **CSE422L: Artificial Intelligence Lab** (Spring 2025). The objective of this project is to build predictive models that classify consumers based on their likelihood to churn (i.e., stop purchasing). This classification helps businesses implement data-driven marketing strategies and better understand consumer behavior.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pg5z2_6OJsdd7VxGEfa8oXAihYq1KYtV/view)
- **Size**: 1500 records
- **Features**: 9 (both numerical and categorical)
- **Target**: Binary (`Churn` → 0: Not Churned, 1: Churned)
- **Balanced?**: Yes (Approx. 50/50 split)

### Key Features

- Demographic: `Age`, `Gender`, `Marital_Status`
- Behavioral: `Num_Purchase`, `Membership_Years`, `Device_Used`
- Financial: `Income`, `Credit_Score`

---

## 📈 EDA Summary

- Younger individuals and those with lower income/credit scores tend to churn more.
- Mobile device users show higher churn rates.
- Marital status plays a role: Single users churn more frequently.
- Most variables have weak correlation, indicating multifactorial influence on churn behavior.

---

## 🧹 Preprocessing

- **Missing Values**:
  - Imputed using `median` (numerical) and `mode` (categorical)
- **Encoding**:
  - Used `Label Encoding` for `Gender`, `Marital_Status`, `Device_Used`
- **Scaling**:
  - Applied `StandardScaler` to standardize numeric features
- **Splitting**:
  - Train/Test split (70/30) with **Stratified Sampling** to preserve class distribution

---

## 🤖 Modeling

Four classification models were trained and evaluated:

1. **K-Nearest Neighbors**
   - `k=5`, Euclidean distance
   - Accuracy: 49.33%

2. **Decision Tree**
   - Criterion: Gini
   - Accuracy: 50.00%

3. **Naive Bayes**
   - GaussianNB
   - Accuracy: 52.44%

4. **Neural Network**
   - Architecture: Input(14) → Hidden(32→16) → Output(1, Sigmoid)
   - Optimizer: Adam | Epochs: 50 | Batch Size: 32
   - Accuracy: 52.89%
   - AUC: 0.5259

## 📊 Results

| Model          | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|----------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| KNN            | 49.33%   | 49%       | 49%    | 49%      |
| Decision Tree  | 50.00%   | 50%       | 50%    | 50%      |
| Naive Bayes    | 52.44%   | 52%       | 52%    | 52%      |
| Neural Network | **52.89%** | **52%**   | **53%**| **53%**  |

> 🔍 **Neural Network outperformed others**, but all models showed marginal improvements over random guessing.

---

## 🧾 Conclusion

- The best model (Neural Network) achieved only ~53% accuracy, suggesting **limited predictive power** from the existing features.
- Stronger predictive models likely require **richer consumer data** (e.g., browsing behavior, purchase history).

---

## 🚀 Future Work

- Use **Ensemble Models** (e.g., Gradient Boosting, Random Forest)
- Explore **Deeper Neural Networks**
- Add features like:
  - Social media engagement
  - Time of last purchase
  - Session duration or clickstream data
